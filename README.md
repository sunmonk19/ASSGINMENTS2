a is variable, if a/2 is equal to zero then we can print the number as even, if it not then it go the else statement where printed as odd number.

first we have to set counter variable which is sumtotal to 0.after that we will iterate the number from 1 to 50
after each iteration we will add the previous sumtotal and print sumtotal
